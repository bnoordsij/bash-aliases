# Bash alias
These are some aliases / functions that I use to make my life easier, you might find some useful, some not so much

## Getting started

```
cd ~
git clone git@git.maximum.nl:bart.noordsij/bash-alias.git bash-alias
```

in .profile
`source ~/bash-alias/main`

you need to check the folders in the cd file, they are specifically set for me

you can replace some with the following command:
`sed -i 's-/Users/bart/dev-/Users/user_dir-' cd`
